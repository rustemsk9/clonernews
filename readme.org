I sent in a tongue‑in‑cheek entry, a batch file that used PKZIP to “compile” code into PKZIP.OBJ (instead of .ZIP) and then ZIP2EXE to “link” it into an EXE. The result was an executable that unzipped itself back into a source file. He was amused enough to mention it near the end of his column, though he noted it didn’t quite qualify for the contest since I hadn’t written PKZIP myself.<p>I found scans of his section on archive.org, including the issue where he announces the contest, but I couldn&#x27;t find my particular contribution. I&#x27;ve narrowed it down to the eight issues listed above that are in the right time-frame.<p>If you have any of these issues (paper or PDF), could you please check Wilf’s section near the back and see if my submission is mentioned?<p>Thanks!",

** Best ways to avoid rate limiting:
optimize your code to eliminate any unnecessary requests
usage of throttling/debouncing functions/techniques to regulate the number of requests.

** Optional: 
You can Handle sub-commments for stories, jobs and polls, by implementing nested comments.

** Live Data
The coolest part of Firebase is its support for change notifications. While you can subscribe to individual items and profiles, you'll need to use the following to observe front page ranking, new items, and new profiles.

** AI instructions
firebase has support for change notifications, but do i understand correctly, my js project cannot access it right away, i need profile or subscribe function for this?

You're correct in your understanding! Firebase change notifications (also known as real-time listeners) do require you to set up listeners or subscriptions in your JavaScript code - they don't automatically push changes to your application.

Here's how it works:

** Firebase Real-time Database
For the Realtime Database, you use `.on()` to subscribe to changes:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
import { ref, onValue } from 'firebase/database';

const db = getDatabase();
const dataRef = ref(db, 'path/to/data');

// Subscribe to changes
const unsubscribe = onValue(dataRef, (snapshot) => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  console.log('Data changed:', data);
});

// Unsubscribe when done
// unsubscribe();
#+END_SRC

** Cloud Firestore
For Firestore, you use `onSnapshot()` to listen for changes:
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript

import { doc, onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore';

const db = getFirestore();
const docRef = doc(db, 'collection', 'document');

// Subscribe to document changes
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(docRef, (doc) => {
  console.log('Document data:', doc.data());
});

// Unsubscribe when done
// unsubscribe();
#+END_SRC

** Key Points:

1. **Active Subscription Required**: You must explicitly set up listeners in your code
2. **Not Automatic**: Firebase doesn't push changes without your code requesting them
3. **Persistent Connection**: These listeners maintain a persistent connection to Firebase
4. **Cleanup Important**: Always unsubscribe when components unmount to avoid memory leaks
5. **Real-time**: Once subscribed, you get instant updates when data changes

So yes, you need to implement subscription/listener functions in your JavaScript code to receive Firebase's real-time updates. The changes don't just appear in your app automatically.
